= Example with Java records and Spring Boot =

== Introduction

With Java 16 a new feature to generate new classes has appeared (an introductions was made with Java 14). This
new feature attempts to reduce the boilerplate to generate new classes and the only thing that you have to do
is define fields.

Theses new classes are going to be immutables and are good to generate dto's or classes for configuration.

For example, you are going to define a new class with a record in the next way:

        public record BrandDto(@JsonProperty("id") Long id, @JsonProperty("name") String name) {
        }

== How does it run?

This is a simple Spring Boot application so to run it you can run the next command from maven:

    mvn spring-boot:run
